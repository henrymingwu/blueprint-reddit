Welcome to Interface!

You can use the command prompt to do a lot of awesome things with our database.

Interface consists of: Users, Communities, and Articles

Once you choose which of these groups you want to learn more about (i.e. select Users), you can do more specific things within these groups.

Users commands:
printAll
printUsersInCommunity
findUser


Articles commands:
printAll
printArticlesInCommunity
mostFavorited
mostRecent

Communities:
printAll
findCommunity


The system instructions should help you find what you need.
